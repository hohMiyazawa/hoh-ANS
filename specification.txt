# Header
---
1 byte, magic number 153
3 bytes, "HOH"
1 byte, pixel format
	pixel formats:
		0: bitimage
		1: greyscale
		2: rgb
		3: greyscale + alpha
		4: rgb + alpha
		255: FORBIDDEN (explicitely mark this as an invalid HOH image)
		more formats TBD (YCbCr?)
	
1 byte, depth
varint, width-1
varint, height-1
---

header notes:
	- when multiple planes exists, the order is alpha > green > red > blue
	- for "0", no image data is stored, it's still a valid image
	- there's no arbitrary metadata. This is not a complete image format, and should be wrapped.
	- reading the first 16 bytes should give all header information, unless the image is billions of pixels wide and high.
